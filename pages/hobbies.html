            <p>
                Outside of academics and professional work, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me
                <strong>physically active</strong> and <em>mentally engaged</em>.

                <h3>Bouldering and Top Roping</h3>
                <p>
                    Rock climbing has become one of my favorite physical activities. I enjoy both bouldering
                    and top roping, which challenge me both physically and mentally. The problem-solving aspect
                    of finding the right route and technique makes each climb unique and rewarding.

                <h3>Weight Lifting</h3>
                <p>
                    Strength training is an important part of my fitness routine. I focus on compound movements
                    and progressive overload to build strength and maintain overall health.

                <p>
                    Running has been a passion of mine for years. Whether it's sprinting on the track or
                    long-distance cross country runs, I appreciate the discipline and endurance these sports develop.
