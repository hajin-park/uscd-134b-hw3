        <h1>Hobbies</h1>

        <p>
            Outside of academics and professional work, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me
            <strong>physically active</strong> and <em>mentally engaged</em>.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Bouldering and Top Roping</h3>
            <p>
                Rock climbing has become one of my favorite physical activities. I enjoy both bouldering
                and top roping, which challenge me both physically and mentally. The problem-solving aspect
                of finding the right route and technique makes each climb unique and rewarding.

            <h3>Weight Lifting</h3>
            <p>
                Strength training is an important part of my fitness routine. I focus on compound movements
                and progressive overload to build strength and maintain overall health.

            <p>
                Running has been a passion of mine for years. Whether it's sprinting on the track or
                long-distance cross country runs, I appreciate the discipline and endurance these sports develop.

                fiction that offers new perspectives and creative storytelling.
